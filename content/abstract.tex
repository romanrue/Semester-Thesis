\chapter*{Abstract}

For more than half a century the application of reinforced carbon fiber polymers has been pushing the design of lightweight structures to new limits. A number of macroscopic failure criteria evolved that fit the failure prediction of every stress state in unidirectional carbon fibers based on characteristic values in its principal stress states. Despite the abundance of failure criteria the available experimental data to evaluate them is scarce.
